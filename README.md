# POAFS-Peer

POAFS is a system to transfer files between peers on a network, much like a torrent.However, the difference is that in order to gain access to a file you must fisrt authenticate with the authroisation server.

This is the code for the POAFS peer, it handles the encryption, decryption and transfer of files across the network.
